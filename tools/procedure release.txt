--------------------           Release de Slyum             --------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document explains the process to follow for releasing Slyum.

For each release, there is a multiplatform version (.jpln and .jar) and a 
Mac OS X version (App Bundle). All files must be stored in the 
"latest release/" directory.

Files that are currently in the "latest release/" directory must be moved
in the "previous release/<current version>/" directory. The current version
of Slyum can be found in the About box (Slyum -> Help -> About Slyum...).
Don't move the "Slyum.jnlp" file (even if it has changed)!

1) Executable Java (.jar)
   Put in the "latest release/" directory the compiled jar version of the 
   latest release of Slyum.

   !!! IMPORTANT !!! : You MUST sign the jar file! You can use keytool and 
                       jarsigner (given by Java) for sign your jar.

2) Java Web Start (.jnlp)
   The .jnlp located in the "latest release/" directory is the same for each
   release. Except if you want to modify it's content, there is no need to take 
   care of. However, here is some doc if you want to change something:

   http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/javaws/developersguide/syntax.html

3) On Mac OS X, Slyum is distributed with "Slyum.app".
   For the bundle creation, please see the "tools/readme.macosx.txt" file.
   Like others released files, the bundle must be placed in the "latest release/"
   directory. With the name "Slyum.app".
