For each release, there is a multiplatform version (.jar) and a 
Mac OS X version (App Bundle). All files must be stored in the 
"latest release/" directory.

Files that are currently in the "latest release/" directory must be moved
in the "previous release/<current version>/" (only for major and minor version) 
directory. The current version of Slyum can be found in the About box 
(Slyum -> Help -> About Slyum...).
Take the utils/version.html file and move it to the "previous release/<current version>/" too.

0) Don't forget to update the version number in swing.Slyum.java ("version" constant).

1) Executable Java (.jar)
   Put in the "latest release/" directory the compiled jar version of the 
   latest release of Slyum. Put it in a zip file.

2) On Mac OS X, Slyum is distributed with "Slyum.app".
   For the bundle creation, please see the "tools/readme.macosx.txt" file.
   Like others released files, the bundle must be placed in the "latest release/"
   directory. Zip it. With the name "SlyumAppBundle.zip".
