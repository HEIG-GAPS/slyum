--------------------           Release de Slyum             --------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document explains the process to follow for releasing Slyum.

For each release, there is a multiplatform version (.jar) and a 
Mac OS X version (App Bundle). All files must be stored in the 
"latest release/" directory.

Files that are currently in the "latest release/" directory must be copied (not moved!!)
in the "bin/previous release/<current version>/" (only for major and minor version but not for patch) 
directory. The current version of Slyum can be found in the About box 
(Slyum -> Help -> About Slyum...).
Take the bin/utils/version.html file and copy it to the "bin/previous release/<current version>/" too.

0) Don't forget to update the version number in swing.Slyum.java ("version" constant).
   Create the jar. In the Files view from Netbeans, rigth click on build-slyum.xml -> Run Target -> Other Targets -> package-for-store.
   The created jar will be located in the store folder.

1) Executable Java (.jar)
   Put in the "bin/latest release/" directory the compiled jar version of the 
   latest release of Slyum. Put it in a zip file.

2) On Mac OS X, Slyum is distributed with "Slyum.app".
   For the bundle creation, please see the "tools/readme.macosx.txt" file.
   Like others released files, the bundle must be placed in the "bin/latest release/"
   directory. Zip it. With the name "SlyumAppBundle.zip".
 
3) Edit the version.html file and change it's content to the appropriate one. 
   Don't change links ([download] or [updater]).
 
	1) Change the version number into the [version] tag to the appropriate one.
	2) Change the update patch into the [history] tag. You can use basic HTML.
	
4) Update the description in Slyum Google Code.

5) Commit.

If you want to update the Slyum updater, process the same as the Slyum update.
Change the [updater] tag corresponding to the updater version instead of the [version] tag.
No need to change any version number in the source files. It will automatically be updated in the properties file of Slyum.
