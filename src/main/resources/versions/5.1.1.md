## Fixes

* macOS Ventura: Slyum runs normally.
* PDF exportation: abstract classes' names are now displayed correctly, in italic ([~~#114~~](https://github.com/HEIG-GAPS/slyum/issues/114) and [~~#102~~](https://github.com/HEIG-GAPS/slyum/issues/102)).
* Better handling of right clicks on macOS ([~~#45~~](https://github.com/HEIG-GAPS/slyum/issues/45)).

## Changes

* New key bindings, related to exportation:
  * Export as image: <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd>
  * Export as PDF: <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>
  * Export as EPS: <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd>
  * Export as SVG: <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>
* The updater does not update Slyum directly anymore. It notifies the user and redirect the user to the GitHub latest release page ([~~#78~~](https://github.com/HEIG-GAPS/slyum/issues/78)).
